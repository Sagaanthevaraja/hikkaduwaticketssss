    <h2>Threats to Turtles</h2>
    <p>Sea turtles are strong and durable. Since the time of the dinosaurs, they have swum the seas, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. However, in recent times, due to the quickly expanding human population, there have been new, intense pressures that have made it harder for sea turtles to survive. Five primary threats to sea turtles worldwide have been identified by the IUCN-SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group: fishing bycatch, coastal development, pollution and pathogens, direct take, and climate change. Find out more about these threats and how you can assist. (SWOT, 2018)</p>
    <h3>Main Threats to Turtles</h3>

            <h3> 1.Development of Coastal Areas</h3><br>
            <img src="images/Picture11.jpg" >
            <p>Because of receding coastlines, sea turtle habitats are destroyed every year. Sea turtle food supplies and nesting areas are severely impacted wherever there is boat vessel traffic, whenever a new hotel or high-rise is built up along the shore, and wherever the sea floor is dug up and the beach erodes. (SWOT, 2018)</p>
            <p>Sea turtles and other species share coastlines with us, making them special places. We can contribute to preserving these areas' vitality and health for future generations by choosing better ways to use them. Choose to stay at a hotel or resort that promotes turtle-friendly tourism and works to protect its surroundings. Close drapes, turn off unnecessary lights, use your flashlight sparingly, secure all trash, fill in holes to make sea turtle pathways between surf and sand as smooth as possible, keep pets on a leash at all times, and steer clear of driving on the beach if possible if you want to lessen the impact you have on sea turtles. These recommendations can help guarantee that sea turtles stay healthy and vibrant.</p>

            <h3> 2.Marine Pollution</h3><br>
            <img src="images/picture13.jpg">
            <p>Sea turtles are harmed by marine pollution in a number of ways. Sea turtles are harmed by ingesting and becoming entangled in debris such as plastic pollution, fishing gear left out to sea, petroleum byproducts, and other objects. The immune systems of the turtles may be weakened by ocean pollution, which may also interfere with nesting habits and hatchling orientation. (SWOT, 2018)</p>
            <p>Sea turtles are impacted by pollution in a variety of ways, so it's crucial to evaluate the products you use and choose which ones to replace with more environmentally friendly options. Change from disposable plastic bottles to reusable metal or plastic bottles and from disposable plastic bags to reusable cloth bags in order to reduce, reuse, and recycle. Also, take into account a product's entire life cycle and aid businesses that are dedicated to the best environmental practices. Finally, organize or take part in a cleanup to stop trash from being dumped into the ocean.</p>

            <h3>3.Turtles are being killed</h3><br>
            <img src="images/picture12.jpg">
            <p>Turtles are killed all over the world and sold as exotic food, oil, leather, and jewelry on the international market. Millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been killed over the past century just for the value of their shells. Even though efforts to promote conservation have resulted in a decline in the global trade in luxury and handicrafts, turtles continue to face danger in some regions of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. (SWOT, 2018)</p>
            <p>Around the world, sea turtles are killed for food and profit, both legally and illegally. The illegal international trade of turtle products poses a serious threat to sea turtles, especially hawksbills. People should refrain from consuming or acquiring items made of tortoiseshell in order to help eradicate the consumer market for sea turtle products. Learn how to spot tortoiseshell-made items so you can avoid them wherever they go. Please report any tortoiseshell items you find.</p>
