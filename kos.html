        <p>Life is all about the little things that fill your heart with love, right? For the kind people at the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery, it most certainly is. This animal welfare organization truly cares about these young animals, even before they are born. Six of the seven species of sea turtles are now in danger of extinction. The majority of it results from the exploitation of natural resources by humans. Thankfully, this hatchery has accepted responsibility for their protection. Beginning with watching over the nesting mother turtles, they then transport their eggs to the safe environment of the hatchery and, on the day of birth, release the young turtles into the sea. (Cinnamon Hotels, 2023)</p>
        
       
        <p>If there are problems, they tend to them and only release them when they are healthy enough to enter the vast ocean. All five of the country's species can be found making their nests at Kosgoda, one of the very few hatcheries. They are the Hawksbill, Leatherback, Green, and Olive Ridley turtles. Don't forget to ask our staff if you could release some of these delicate creatures into the ocean during your visit to feel the rewarding feeling of doing so! The first two or three times the wave hits the helpless souls, they start flapping back. However, after they fly into their houses, the ocean fills your heart with such joy. (Cinnamon Hotels, 2023)
